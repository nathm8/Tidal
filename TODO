TODO
===============

Planet
------------
Turn terrain into impermeable particle body group, implement terrain
destruction for more dynamism

Software
------------
Try native linux build, see if more performant

UI
------------
Sliders for terrain bumpiness, mass scaling
Button for spawning in additional water

Water Particle
---------------
change colour when at different heights, to give a "cloud" look
temperature forces?
    could give particles lifetimes after which they "evaporate", then spawn
    in a replacement from the "clouds"
look into porting static pressure

graphics
--------------
metaball shader, to give our particles hard edges

gameplay
--------------
have internal particular particle "mineral" pockets.
player ships to orbit planet, shoot to push particles around or detach "solid" particles, suck them up, shoot them out elsewhere

Done 
===============
Planet
---------------
Add an "atmosphere" barrier
make into static body
    triangulate to centre

Moon
---------------
Use code from Orbital Bombardment, put it on a rail around the planet

Water Particle
---------------
Generate, evenly across the surface
Simple alpha-sprite for first-pass graphics
