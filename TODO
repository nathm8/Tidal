TODO
===============

Port static pressure particles from C++ LiquidFun

implement scaling between pixels\heaps render space and Box2D physics space.

Ideas
===============
Planet
------------
Can fake Coriolis by just lagging the moon's graphics lol

UI
------------
Sliders for terrain bumpiness, mass scaling
Button for spawning in additional water

Water Particle
---------------
change colour when at different heights, to give a "cloud" look
temperature forces?
    could give particles lifetimes after which they "evaporate", then spawn
    in a replacement from the "clouds"
    colour-mixing as a way to exchange temp
    on certain temps, phase change
    Certain types with bouyancy or other forces?
    Light = temp?

graphics
--------------
ðŸš«metaball shader, to give our particles hard edges
    not needed, blur is fine

gameplay
--------------
have internal particular particle "mineral" pockets.
player ships to orbit planet, shoot to push particles around or detach "sand" particles, suck them up, shoot them out elsewhere

Done 
===============
Planet
---------------
Turn terrain into impermeable particle body group
implement terrain destruction for more dynamism
Add an "atmosphere" barrier
make into static body
    triangulate to centre

Moon
---------------
Use code from Orbital Bombardment, put it on a rail around the planet

Water Particle
---------------
Generate, evenly across the surface
Simple alpha-sprite for first-pass graphics

N-Body Gravity
---------------
