===============

Planet
------------
Turn terrain into impermeable particle body group, implement terrain
destruction for more dynamism

Try native linux build, see if more performant

UI
------------
Sliders for terrain bumpiness, mass scaling
Button for spawning in additional water

Water Particle
---------------
change colour when at different heights, to give a "cloud" look
temperature forces?
    could give particles lifetimes after which they "evaporate", then spawn
    in a replacement from the "clouds"
look into porting static pressure
